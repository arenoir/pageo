			Pageo Lavender Farm will be open from April 28th thru the summer and box lunches will be served on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

			Hours are: Thursday-Saturday from 9AM to 4PM (Beginning in August, Saturday hours will be 9AM to 1PM)

			Stop by and visit our gift shop or just sit and relax in our beautiful park like setting.

			Our Mothers Day luncheon was a great success this year. We thank everybody who was a part of the special day.
