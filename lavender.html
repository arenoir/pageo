			Pageo is a working farm that grows and harvests the lavender used in its handmade products, from soaps and lotions to linens sprays. Pageo grows two types of lavender: Grosso and Loddon Blue.<br><br>

			Grosso is very common for distillation and is often used for itâ€™s aromatherapeutic properties. Grosso lavender grown at Pageo is either sold fresh, distilled to make lavender oil, and is also dried for swags, sachets, or soap making. Loddon Blue is an English Lavender, or Lavendula Angustofolia, which is used in many items such as culinary purposes to bath products.<br><br>

			The Lavender blooms every year in June, so make sure to make a special visit to see how brilliant it looks during this time.
