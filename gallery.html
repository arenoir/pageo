			Pageo Lavender Farm is nestled in the heart of California's San Joaquin Valley between Modesto and Merced. The grounds have a sophisticated rustic atmosphere that is inviting with the smell of lavender and the lush green landscape. The gift shop is stocked with soaps, lotions, lavender sachets, wreaths and architectural amenities for the garden. At Pageo we grow all of our lavender, herbs and produce pesticide and herbicide free.

			Our field has more than 10 varieties of lavender which can be used for culinary and ornamental use. We also grow yarrow which is a rich golden flowering herb that may also be used for culinary and decorative purposes. In addition to lavender, we grow exotic peppers, fruit and a variety of herbs.
