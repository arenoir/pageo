		<p>Our wedding was truly magical and we couldn't have asked for a better venue and overall experience. I highly recommend Pageo Lavender Farm to anyone looking for a beautiful venue in the Central Valley. It's run by wonderful (and organized) people, who truly care, and will do everything they can to make you feel at ease during one of the biggest moments in your life. I am so glad we chose Pageo for our Wedding Day, and I promise that you will too!&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Pageo is the best decision we made about our wedding. They were extremely accommodating, especially during the lockdown. They walked us through everything and provided so much assistance, genuinely they are the reason that our wedding was as successful as it was. Not to mention that the venue is absolutely gorgeous - all of our guests were absolutely amazed. If you want to have a feeling that your loved is helping you plan the wedding, go with Pageo. They made us feel like family.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Pageo and their staff are the REAL DEAL. Such a dream team to work with. They made everything so easy and took so much off of my plate as a bride that I thought I had to do and coordinate. Our day (and many days leading up to it) were amazing because of Pageo. We are consistently complimented on our venue choice. From getting ready in the gorgeous bridal suite to the last minutes of our sparkler send off, it was a dream!&rdquo;</p>
